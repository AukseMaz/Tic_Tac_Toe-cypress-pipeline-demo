# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a Cypress end-to-end (E2E) testing setup for a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built with React and Vite.

## 📌  Project Overview

- Tests the Tic-Tac-Toe app using Cypress.  
- Runs automated UI tests for game logic (X/O moves, win/draw conditions, reset functionality).  
- Uses Vite as the development server.  
- Supports interactive Cypress testing (UI mode) and headless testing (CLI mode).

```

## 📜 Cypress Test Cases

The following test cases are included in cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js:

✅ TC01: Load the app and verify the title.  
✅ TC02: Check if the board renders with 9 empty squares.  
✅ TC03: Ensure 'X' is placed first, followed by 'O'.  
✅ TC04: Prevent clicking on an already filled square.  
✅ TC05: Detect a winning condition.  
✅ TC06: Detect a draw condition.  
✅ TC07: Reset game.  

## 🚀 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing and ensure code quality before merging changes into the master branch. The GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/node.js.yml) performs the following steps:

1️⃣ Triggers:

- Runs on push and pull_request events targeting the master branch.

2️⃣ Environment:

- Executes on Ubuntu (latest version).  
- Uses Node.js 18.x. 

3️⃣ Build & Test Steps:  

- Checks out the repository.  
- Installs dependencies using npm ci (ensures a clean install).  
- Starts the React application in the background.  
- Waits for the application to be ready.  
- Runs Cypress tests for end-to-end testing.
